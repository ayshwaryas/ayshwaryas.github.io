My page has moved to [https://www.cellhomology.space/](https://www.cellhomology.space/). 

I am a Computational Biologist at the [Klarman Cell Observatory](https://www.broadinstitute.org/klarman-cell-observatory) at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org) working with [Aviv Regev](https://www.broadinstitute.org/regev-lab), [Vijay Kuchroo](https://kuchroolab.bwh.harvard.edu/) and [Ana Anderson](https://anacandersonlab.com/). I am involved in the [Human Cell Atlas's](https://www.humancellatlas.org) efforts on kidney with [Anna Greka](http://grekalab.bwh.harvard.edu/anna-greka/). 

My research focus is on decoding heterogeneity and evolution of states in complex human diseases across scales from cells to systems. I am interested in the design, development, and applications of computational data analyses methods for the understanding of human health and disease, its prevention and treatment. I work at the interface of high-throughput omics, applied statistics and machine learning, and experimental design.

I completed my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) with [Russell Schwartz](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~russells/). My dissertation focused on developing computational methods for resolving heterogeneity in high-throughput data from tumors, detecting progression markers, and using these markers for phylogenetic inference. My postdoctoral training was completed at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Healthâ€™s](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu) [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), with [Curtis Huttenhower](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu) and [Rafael Irizarry](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/rafael-irizarry/), where I developed probabilistic models of transcriptional activity states from bulk transcriptome sequencing data and approaches for analysis of metagenomic data.
